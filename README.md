# Develop an application which contains a curated feed of trending tech products and innovations
# happening across the world. A user can browse through the large set of products inside the feed
# and read in-detail about every tech product. A user should also be able to upvote a product,
# bookmark it and share it through social media. There will be some quick filters to help users filter
# out the best content based on the user's preferences (Like Trending in Machine Learning,
# Featured Home Automations, etc.).
